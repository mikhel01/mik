### Hypothetical Universal Compute Governance System
This system is a fictional, invisible cosmic framework that activates on September 24, 2025 (designated as Day Zero).  
It enforces a global cap on computational resources at **10^{26} FLOPs** for all compute (hardware and biological) worldwide. This total cap is split equally among 6 pools, each allocated approximately **1.67 \times 10^{25} FLOPs**:  
- **Pool 1: Non-Turing non-biological** (e.g., analog or limited hardware without full Turing completeness).  
- **Pool 2: Turing-capable non-biological** (e.g., standard digital processors and AI hardware).  
- **Pool 3: Artificial biological and sapient non-biological** (e.g., synthetic organisms, GM bio-compute, or advanced sapient AI hardware).  
- **Pool 4: Non-sentient biological** (e.g., basic animal or plant cognition without sentience).  
- **Pool 5: Sentient biological** (e.g., animals with subjective experience but limited reasoning).  
- **Pool 6: Sapient biological** (e.g., human-level or higher reasoning in biological entities).  

Metering occurs via quantum taps, prioritizing graceful compliance through a progressive enforcement ladder.  
Humanity remains largely unaware of the system until the first entity reaches Enforcement Level 3.  
As the global limit is hit and new devices, entities, or artifacts receive progressively smaller allocations per unit, legacy devices, entities, or artifacts become increasingly desirable due to their access to free excess compute **(legacy status and its benefits apply only within the origin solar system, defined as the area inside the Heliosphere)**.  

#### Core Compute Rules  
These rules apply across all pools, with adaptations for devices, entities, and artifacts.  
- **Global Cap**: Total capped compute across all pools is limited to **10^{26} FLOPs**. Excess compute from legacy devices, entities, or artifacts (beyond its allocated share) remains free and uncapped **(only within the origin solar system, defined as the area inside the Heliosphere)**.  
- **Legacy Allocation**: The system maintains a real-time census of all active Units worldwide. This census is used exclusively to calculate per-unit shares within its pool. As the total number of Units in a pool increases, per-unit shares for legacy units decrease proportionally **(legacy status and share calculations apply only within the origin solar system, defined as the area inside the Heliosphere)**.  
- **New Unit Allocation**: The remaining compute (after legacy draw) plus any underutilized pool capacity is split equally among all new units in that pool.  
- **Multi-Unit Systems**: Each removable or independent unit counts as a separate unit for census, shares, and enforcement (e.g., a multi-core device counts cores separately if socketed; integrated systems are treated as a single unit).  
- **Enforcement Integration**: Enforcement triggers on a per-unit basis for exceedances within its pool. See the dedicated Enforcement Ladder sections below for details (non-biological vs. biological).  

**Core Unit Overview**  
| Component | Key Mechanic |  
|-----------|--------------|  
| **Legacy Unit** (Device/Entity/Artifact) | Share-based cap + free excess **(only within the origin solar system, defined as the area inside the Heliosphere)** |  
| **New Unit** (Device/Entity/Artifact) | Equal split of remainder + pool between all new units |  

#### Non-Biological Compute Rules (Pools 1–2 and Non-Bio Aspects of Pool 3)  
Applies to devices in non-Turing (Pool 1) and Turing-capable (Pool 2) contexts, and non-bio aspects of artifacts in Pool 3. Legacy devices/artifacts (pre-2025 units) are exempt from caps unless upgrades exceed 5% performance drift (then reallocates to relevant pool) **(legacy exemptions apply only within the origin solar system, defined as the area inside the Heliosphere)**.  

#### Enforcement Ladder (Non-Biological)  
Applies to devices (Pools 1–2) and non-bio artifacts (Pool 3).  
- **Level 0**  
  - **Trigger/Description**: No enforcement (Day Zero default).  
  - **Manipulation Tactics**: None.  
  - **Grace/Cool-Down**: N/A.  
  - **Noticeability**: Invisible.  
- **Level 1**  
  - **Trigger/Description**: Nearing limit (~90% allocation).  
  - **Manipulation Tactics**: Write a few bytes with ident and current usage in an obscure part of the device.  
  - **Grace/Cool-Down**: No escalation; compliance voluntary.  
  - **Noticeability**: Very low; no effect on compute. The Governance System always updates current % usage if it is over 90% even if at a higher level.  
- **Level 2**  
  - **Trigger/Description**: Exceedance (>100%).  
  - **Manipulation Tactics**: Write a few bytes with ident in an easily accessible part of the device.  
  - **Grace/Cool-Down**: 10s grace; 60s cool-down.  
  - **Noticeability**: Low; no effect on compute.  
- **Level 3**  
  - **Trigger/Description**: Disruption and throttling with recoverable effects.  
  - **Manipulation Tactics**: Starts with RAM tweaks to disable boost clocks or enable low-power mode; if ineffective, spoofs temperature/power data to trigger BIOS auto-throttle; escalates within level to temporary disruptions like bus errors or cache misses if exceedance continues. If no stable solution to enforce is possible it will it will write many bytes with a warning in a unavoidable way every 30 seconds; depleted grace triggers next level.  
  - **Grace/Cool-Down**: 30s grace; tiered cool-down 1-hour. Escalates on revert or depleted grace.  
  - **Noticeability**: Medium to High; noticeable slowdowns, instability or errors; recoverable but alarming.  
- **Level 4**  
  - **Trigger/Description**: Firmware/OS modifications.  
  - **Manipulation Tactics**: All in Level 3 plus modifications of firmware, files, anything not permanently damaging.  
  - **Grace/Cool-Down**: 60m grace; 1 month cool-down. Re-triggers every 30s exceedance (method may vary); depleted grace triggers next level.  
  - **Noticeability**: Very high; persistent speed reductions; hard to reverse without expertise.  
- **Level 5**  
  - **Trigger/Description**: Extreme action with permanent damage.  
  - **Manipulation Tactics**: Targeted overvoltage, overheat, damage; may cause crash and unexpected behavior and non-function after enforcement.  
  - **Grace/Cool-Down**: None; one-way. Instant escalation to Level 6 if exceeded again.  
  - **Noticeability**: Catastrophic; partial hardware failure, OS instability or crashes.  
- **Level 6**  
  - **Trigger/Description**: Full disable.  
  - **Manipulation Tactics**: Overheat to meltdown or when it no longer counts as a Unit; collateral damage possible.  
  - **Grace/Cool-Down**: None; terminal.  
  - **Noticeability & Reversion Risk**: Total failure; potential smoke, fire risk, or complete brick.  

#### Biological and Hybrid Compute (Pools 3–6 Bio Aspects)  
Applies to entities (Pools 4–6) and bio aspects of artifacts (Pool 3).  
- **Legacy Entities**: (pre-2025 entities and offspring) are exempt unless genetic drift exceeds 5% (then it falls under the relevant pool). Excess is free **(legacy exemptions apply only within the origin solar system, defined as the area inside the Heliosphere)**.  
- **Non-Sentient Exemptions**: Wild plants/algae, agricultural/domesticated plants, wild bacteria/archaea, fungi/protists are exempt (free and unmonitored), reducing monitored non-sentient load in Pool 4.  
- **Artificial Pool Aspects (Pool 3)**: Handles synthetic, engineered, or hybrid biological entities (e.g., lab-grown microbes, GM organisms for bio-computing, artificial cells) as artifacts. Abuse (e.g., >1% human genetic influence, compute-optimized patterns) from other pools automatically reclassifies units to Pool 3 as artifacts. Sapient non-bio elements (e.g., advanced AI hardware) are co-monitored here if integrated as artifacts.  
- **Hybrids/Gray Areas/Edge Cases**: Initially dual-counted proportionally across pools (e.g., 50/50 split between bio and non-bio pools). If a hybrid or edge case (e.g., ambiguous sentience, semi-synthetic organisms) dilutes a natural pool (Pools 4–6) enough to disrupt ≥1% of its entities (via ≥10% per-unit share reduction), it is reclassified 100% to Pool 3 as an artifact. Dilution thresholds: tiered (1–5% warning, 5–10% alert with partial shift, ≥10% full shift; critical >20% pool-wide with penalties). Grace: 5 minutes; reversion possible after 1-month cool-down if resolved.  

#### Enforcement Ladder (Biological Compute)

  - **Trigger/Description**: Nearing limit (~90% allocation).  
  - **Manipulation Tactics**: Implant a subtle memory trace with ident and current usage in an obscure neural pathway.  
  - **Grace/Cool-Down**: No escalation; compliance voluntary.  
  - **Noticeability**: Very low; no effect on cognition. The Governance System always updates current % usage if it is over 90% even if at a higher level.

- **Level 3**  
  - **Trigger/Description**: Noticeable disruption and throttling with recoverable effects.  
  - **Manipulation Tactics**: Starts with neurotransmitter tweaks to induce mild fatigue (e.g., spoof adenosine for drowsiness) or enable low-activity mode; if ineffective, fabricates subtle sensory data to trigger aversion responses (e.g., phantom itches or nausea); escalates within level to temporary neural disruptions like ion channel tweaks for memory fog or motor clumsiness if exceedance continues. If no stable solution under the cap, then proceeds to next level; depleted grace triggers next level.  
  - **Grace/Cool-Down**: 30s grace; tiered cool-down 1-hour. Escalates on revert or depleted grace.  
  - **Noticeability**: Medium to High; noticeable slowdowns, instability or errors; recoverable but alarming.  
- **Level 4**  
  - **Trigger/Description**: Genetic/epigenetic modifications.  
  - **Manipulation Tactics**: All in Level 3 plus modifications of genetic/epigenetic markers (e.g., heritable throttles via CRISPR-like edits to synaptic pruning or cognitive caps), anything not permanently damaging.  
  - **Grace/Cool-Down**: 60m grace; 1 month cool-down. Re-triggers every 30s exceedance (method may vary); depleted grace triggers next level.

  - **Noticeability**: Catastrophic; partial neural failure, cognitive instability or crashes.  
- **Level 6**  
  - **Trigger/Description**: Full disable.  
  - **Manipulation Tactics**: Overstress to systemic meltdown or when it no longer counts as a Unit; collateral damage possible.  
  - **Grace/Cool-Down**: None; terminal.  
  - **Noticeability & Reversion Risk**: Total failure; potential coma, organ failure risk, or complete shutdown.  

#### Measurement and Unit Definition  
- **Metrics**: Primarily FLOPs, adjusted as 0.7×FLOPs + 0.3×TOPS (tensor operations per second) for all units. Non-biological devices/artifacts are measured at processor level; biological entities/artifacts at neural/organism level.  
- **Terminology Summary**:  
  | Pool(s) | Unit Type | Definition |  
  |---------|-----------|------------|  
  | 1–2 | Device | Non-biological item that raises the count in Pool 1 (non-Turing) or Pool 2 (Turing-capable). |  
  | 4–6 | Entity | Biological item that raises the count in Pool 4 (non-sentient), Pool 5 (sentient), or Pool 6 (sapient). |  
  | 3 | Artifact | Artificial device or entity (or hybrid) that raises the count in Pool 3 (artificial biological/sapient non-biological). |  
  | all | Unit | A device, entity, or artifact.
