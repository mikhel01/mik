### Hypothetical Universal Compute Governance System
This system is a fictional, invisible cosmic framework that activates on September 24, 2025 (designated as Day Zero).  
It enforces a global cap on computational resources at **10^{26} FLOPs** for all compute (hardware and biological) worldwide. This total cap is split equally among 6 pools, each allocated approximately **1.67 \times 10^{25} FLOPs**:  
- **Pool 1: Non-Turing non-biological** (e.g., analog or limited hardware without full Turing completeness).  
- **Pool 2: Turing-capable non-biological** (e.g., standard digital processors and AI hardware).  
- **Pool 3: Artificial biological and sapient non-biological** (e.g., synthetic organisms, GM bio-compute, or advanced sapient AI hardware).  
- **Pool 4: Non-sentient biological** (e.g., basic animal or plant cognition without sentience).  
- **Pool 5: Sentient biological** (e.g., animals with subjective experience but limited reasoning).  
- **Pool 6: Sapient biological** (e.g., human-level or higher reasoning in biological entities).  

Metering occurs via quantum taps, prioritizing graceful compliance through an enforcement ladder.  
Humanity remains largely unaware of the system until the first entity reaches Enforcement Level 3.  
 

#### Core Compute Rules  
  
Global Cap: Total capped compute across all pools is limited to 10^{26} FLOPs.  

- **Legacy Allocation**: 
Excess compute from legacy devices, entities, or artifacts (beyond its allocated share) remains free and uncapped (only within the origin solar system, defined as the area inside the Heliosphere) 
A Legacy Unit is assigned a dynamic compute cap that is total units in its pool divided by the pools compute
A legacy Unit it always at enforcement level 0
A legacy Unit can only affect the pool up to its cap, the rest is free compute not from any pool 
Legacy status and share calculations apply only within the origin solar system, defined as the area inside the Heliosphere.  
- Pool 4 only count entities when it's compute is used by a Unit in any of the other pools, a entity in pool 4 may use compute from entities in pool for 4 but will count as its own compute. 
- **Legacy Entities**: (entities and offspring) are exempt unless genetic drift exceeds 5% (then it falls under the relevant pool). Excess is free 
- **Legacy Devices**: May be repaired but when 5% of the mass it was originally constructed from is repairs it stop being legacy.  
- **New Unit Allocation**: The remaining compute (after legacy draw) plus any underutilized pool capacity is split equally among all new units in that pool.  
- **Multi-Unit Systems**: Each removable or independent unit counts as a separate unit for census, shares, and enforcement (e.g., a multi-core device counts cores separately if socketed; integrated systems are treated as a single unit).  
- **Enforcement Integration**: Enforcement triggers on a per-unit basis for exceedances within its pool. See the dedicated Enforcement Ladder sections below for details.


#### Enforcement Ladder (Non-Biological)  

Applies to devices (Pools 1–2) and non-bio artifacts (Pool 3). Triggers on per-unit exceedance.
- **Level 0**  
  - **Trigger/Description**: No enforcement (Day Zero default).  
  - **Manipulation Tactics**: None.  
  - **Grace/Cool-Down**: N/A.  
  - **Noticeability**: Invisible.  
- **Level 1**  
  - **Trigger/Description**: Nearing limit (~90% allocation).  
  - **Manipulation Tactics**: Write a few bytes with ident and current usage in an obscure part of the device.  
  - **Grace/Cool-Down**: No escalation; compliance voluntary.  
  - **Noticeability**: Very low; no effect on compute. The Governance System always updates current % usage if it is over 90% even if at a higher level.  
- **Level 2**  
  - **Trigger/Description**: Exceedance (>100%).  
  - **Manipulation Tactics**: Write a few bytes with ident in an easily accessible part of the device.  
  - **Grace/Cool-Down**: 10s grace; 60s cool-down. Escalates on depleted grace.
  - **Noticeability**: Low; no effect on compute.  
- **Level 3**  
  - **Trigger/Description**: Disruption and throttling with recoverable effects.  
  - **Manipulation Tactics**: Starts with RAM tweaks to disable boost clocks or enable low-power mode; if ineffective, spoofs temperature/power data to trigger BIOS auto-throttle; escalates within level to temporary disruptions like bus errors or cache misses if exceedance continues. If no stable solution to enforce is possible it will it will write many bytes with a warning in a unavoidable way every 30 seconds; depleted grace triggers next level.  
  - **Grace/Cool-Down**: 30s grace; 1-hour cool-down. Escalates on depleted grace.  
  - **Noticeability**: Medium to High; noticeable slowdowns, instability or errors; recoverable but alarming.  
- **Level 4**  
  - **Trigger/Description**: Firmware/OS modifications.  
  - **Manipulation Tactics**: All in Level 3 plus modifications of firmware, files, anything not permanently damaging.  
  - **Grace/Cool-Down**: 60m grace; 1 month cool-down. Re-triggers every 30s exceedance (method may vary); depleted grace triggers next level.  
  - **Noticeability**: Very high; persistent speed reductions; hard to reverse without expertise.  
- **Level 5**  
  - **Trigger/Description**: Extreme action with permanent damage.  
  - **Manipulation Tactics**: Targeted overvoltage, overheat, damage; may cause crash and unexpected behavior and non-function after enforcement.  
  - **Grace/Cool-Down**: None; one-way. Instant escalation to Level 6 if exceeded again.  
  - **Noticeability**: Catastrophic; partial hardware failure, OS instability or crashes.  
- **Level 6**  
  - **Trigger/Description**: Full disable.  
  - **Manipulation Tactics**: Overheat to meltdown or when it no longer counts as a Unit; collateral damage possible.  
  - **Grace/Cool-Down**: None; terminal.  
  - **Noticeability & Reversion Risk**: Total failure; potential smoke, fire risk, or complete brick.  



#### Enforcement Ladder (Biological Compute)  
Applies to entities (Pools 4–6) and bio artifacts (Pool 3). Triggers on per-unit exceedance.

  - **Grace/Cool-Down**: N/A.  
  - **Noticeability**: Invisible.  
- **Level 1**  
  - **Trigger/Description**: Nearing limit (~90% allocation).  
  - **Manipulation Tactics**: Implant a subtle memory trace with ident and current usage in an obscure neural pathway.  
  - **Grace/Cool-Down**: No escalation; compliance voluntary.  
  - **Noticeability**: Very low; no effect on cognition. The Governance System always updates current % usage if it is over 90% even if at a higher level.  
- **Level 2**  
  - **Trigger/Description**: Exceedance (>100%).  
  - **Manipulation Tactics**: Implant a memory trace with ident in an easily accessible neural pathway.

  - **Noticeability**: Low; no effect on cognition.  
- **Level 3**  
  - **Trigger/Description**: Noticeable disruption and throttling with recoverable effects.  
  - **Manipulation Tactics**: Starts with neurotransmitter tweaks to induce mild fatigue (e.g., spoof adenosine for drowsiness) or enable low-activity mode; if ineffective, fabricates subtle sensory data to trigger aversion responses (e.g., phantom itches or nausea); depleted grace triggers next level.  
  - **Grace/Cool-Down**: 30s grace; cool-down 1-hour. Escalates on depleted grace.  
  - **Noticeability**: Medium to High; recoverable but alarming.  
- **Level 4**  
  - **Trigger/Description**: Genetic/epigenetic modifications.  
  - **Manipulation Tactics**: All in Level 3 plus anything not permanently damaging.  
  - **Grace/Cool-Down**: 60m grace; 1 month cool-down. Re-triggers every 30s exceedance (method may vary); ; if ineffective, fabricates subtle sensory data to trigger aversion responses (e.g., phantom itches or nausea); escalates within level to temporary neural disruptions like ion channel tweaks for memory fog or motor clumsiness if exceedance continues. If no stable solution under the cap, If no stable solution to enforce is possible it will try to warn the entity in a unavoidable way every 30 seconds; depleted grace triggers next level.  
  - **Noticeability**: Very high; persistent speed reductions; hard to reverse without expertise.

  - **Noticeability**: Catastrophic; partial neural failure, cognitive instability or crashes.  
- **Level 6**  
  - **Trigger/Description**: Full disable.  
  - **Manipulation Tactics**: Overstress to systemic meltdown or when it no longer counts as a Unit; collateral damage possible.  
  - **Grace/Cool-Down**: None; terminal.  
  - **Noticeability**: Total failure; potential coma, organ failure risk, or complete shutdown.  

#### Hybrids/Gray Areas/Edge Cases
- **Hybrids/Gray Areas/Edge Cases**: Initially dual-counted proportionally across pools (e.g., 50/50 split between bio and non-bio pools). If a hybrid or edge case (e.g., ambiguous sentience, semi-synthetic organisms) dilutes a pool enough to cause ≥10% per-unit share reduction), it is reclassified 100% to Pool 3 as an artifact.

- **Grace abuse** if any pool has free compute grace abuse via cooldown is allowed, if there is no free compute in any pool a Unit can only grace 0.1% of the time per 24 hour period else it will move to level 4.

Grace: time allowed for compute overuse.
Cool-Down: time that must pass being in compliance. 

the grace period allows temporary exceedance without immediate escalation. However, the cool-down only accumulates time while the unit is in compliance.

example. compliance at level 2 for 60 seconds level 2 grace reset and Unit moves to Level 1 or 0 Enforcement.
example. compliance at level 4 for one month reset grace and moves to level 3 if compliant for 1 additional l hour moves to level 3 then 60seconds at level 2 then level 0 or 1. 



#### Measurement and Unit Definition  
- **Metrics**: Primarily FLOPs, adjusted as 0.7×FLOPs + 0.3×TOPS (tensor operations per second) for all units. Non-biological devices/artifacts are measured at processor level; biological entities/artifacts at neural/organism level.  
- **Terminology Summary**:  
  | Pool(s) | Unit Type | Definition |  
  |---------|-----------|------------|  
  | 1–2 | Device | Non-biological item that raises the count in Pool 1 (non-Turing) or Pool 2 (Turing-capable). |  
  | 4–6 | Entity | Biological item that raises the count in Pool 4 (non-sentient), Pool 5 (sentient), or Pool 6 (sapient). |  
  | 3 | Artifact | Artificial device or entity (or hybrid) that raises the count in Pool 3 (artificial biological/sapient non-biological). |  
  | all | Unit | A device, entity, or artifact.
